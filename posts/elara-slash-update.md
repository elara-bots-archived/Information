# THIS ISN'T THE FULL LIST
Once I get closer to announce it then this information block will be removed.



# Elara Slash Command Update

> **Tags** warning, `{silent}` is no longer an option. 
> 
> **Why?**: Discord is removing the method to make them not show the "User used /cmd:name on bot_name", makes no sense to keep it.
> 
> **When?**: April 9, 2021
